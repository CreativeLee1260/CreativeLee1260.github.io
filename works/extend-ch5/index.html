            <div class="box sticky">
                <h2>Sticky</h2>
                <p>This is an example of an element with a sticky position. Its position is based on the user's scroll position.</p>
                <!-- Use the empty paragraph element below to briefly explain how to use the sticky position. -->
                <p>The sticky position property allows an elemnt to stick to a specified position within its containing element when the webpage is scrolled.</p>
                
            </div>
            
            <div class="box relative">
                
                <h2>Relative</h2>
                <p>This is an example of an element with a relative position. It can move around a little, depending on the viewport, but it is in a position relative to itself.</p>
                <!-- Use the empty paragraph element below to identify the values you used for the top and left properties and how it affected the relative box. -->
                <p> Setting top: 200px; and left: 80px; on a sticky element positions it to stick 200 pixels from the top and 80 pixels from the left of its container when scrolled to that point.</p>
                
            </div>
            
            <div class="box fixed">
            
                <h2>Fixed</h2>
                <p>This is an example of an element with a fixed position. Its position is relative to the viewport.</p>
                <!-- Use the empty paragraph element below to identify the values you used for the top and right properties and how it affected the fixed box. -->
                <p>Setting top: 110px; and right: 80px; on a fixed element positions it 110 pixels from the top of the viewport and 80 pixels from the right edge, meaning it will remain in that position relative to the viewport as the user scrolls.</p>
                
            </div>
            
            <div class="box absolute">
                
                <h2>Absolute</h2>
                <p>This is an example of an element with an absolute position. It is similar to the fixed position; however, it is positioned relative to the closest parent element.</p>
                <!-- Use the empty paragraph element below to identify the values you used for the bottom and right properties and how it affected the absolute box. -->
                <p>In CSS, using position: absolute; with bottom: 30px; and right: 40px; places the element 30 pixels up from the bottom and 40 pixels in from the right of its closest parent that has a position set.</p>
