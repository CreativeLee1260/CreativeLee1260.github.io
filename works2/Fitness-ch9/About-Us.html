				<h1>Common Exercises</h1>
				<p>The following exercises are ones we encourage our clients to do as part of their daily exercise routine.</p>
				<dl>
					<dt>Burpee</dt>
					<dd>Burpees are a great full-body exercise to increase your strength and endurance. Begin in a standing position, drop into a squat and extend your hands forward, kick your feet back, then forward again quickly, and then jump up from a squatted position.</dd>
					
					<dt>Plank</dt>
					<dd>Planks build your core strength. To perform a plank, get in a push-up position and rest your forearms on the floor. Hold the position for as long as you can.</dd>
					
					<dt>Mountain Climbers</dt>
					<dd>Mountain climbers are a good cardio exercise. Place your hands on the floor in a push-up position, then bring one knee up to your chest, then switch as quickly as you can (as though you are climbing a mountain).</dd>
